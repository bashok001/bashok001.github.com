I'll be blogging here. Thank you for visiting. 

Allow me to introduce myself, my blog, and what I'll be talking about in it (for now at least). I am a computer scientist. My focus is security on mobile platforms. I am a graduate student at _Syracuse University_ and a part of **Cyber Security Research Group (CSRG)** here. I studied Electronics in my undergrad and am sort of `DIY` enthusiast. I started working in Software industry almost 4 years ago. I worked on various technologies and I fell in love with Java and Object Oriented designs.

This brings me to my first focus of this blog:

> Programming. With so many different cuisines of this out there, How am I learning? What are the *cool* stuff out there in this arena.


I am living in times where privacy and targeted attacks on it are growing in number with each day. I am interested in learning the how end of this equation. How a breach happened? 

>I am very interested in understanding _software vulnerabilities_, if any, that are used with this breach. This would be my **major focus**.

I recently started cooking and my pallette is loving it. I will be talking more about this from time to time. I may want to publish my experiments on fire too. Let's see ;). What you can definitely expect is: **`impure`**. I mix a lot of ingredients that I like but normally would not go into the traditional reciepe bowl. 

Also, I'm definitely a tech geek. I am definitely strapped to my laptop. I am interested about anything and easily fascinated with everything. Not very good for focus but I am working on it. I read about technology / gadgets and Internet trends.

**I love:** Intuitive designs.
**I hate:** Technology fragmentation.

I'll be talking to you soon.
